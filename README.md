Your First Independent Project
Three snapshots of people interacting with different kinds of interfaces surrounded by discrete interface elements. On the first snapshot, a person is interacting with a virtual interface and checking checkboxes. On the second one, someone is typing something on a laptop. On the third, a hand is holding several simple interfaces.
Now that you've made it all the way through the lessons of the introductory course, you're finally ready to work on your very first project.
Practicum needs your help! There's a critical page missing from our website. Our users need a page for when there is no page. That's right, it's time to create a webpage with the dreaded 404 error message, to which users can be redirected if the resource they requested doesn't exist.
Error 404: Page not found
Here's the project brief in PDF format — click on the link to download and check it out. This document shows you what the page is supposed to look like and contains detailed instructions on how to code it.
When you look at the brief, you'll see that the webpage has two states:
A webpage with an image and the number "404"
The same webpage, but with some additional text explaining what the 404 error means
Your goal is to implement both of these states using HTML and CSS. In the second state, the additional text appears when the mouse is hovering over the 404. You can implement this feature using CSS.
When you were working through the lessons in the platform, you may have noticed that the code you worked with was split into separate files. To complete this project, you'll also have to work with separate files. These files have already been created for you in the starter kit, which you can download here. It contains index.html, style.css and empty-boxes.svg files. The empty-boxes.svg file contains the image shown in the design.
How does this work?
This popup text should be implemented by using the :hover pseudo-class selector in CSS. You can read more about this selector on MDN, but don't worry about diving into the technical details yet. To begin with, we recommend trying to use this selector in your project and seeing how it works for yourself.
This is what programmers do on a day-to-day basis; they figure things out for themselves and find ways to fix it if something goes wrong. You won't be alone in this.
Once you've finished writing code and you're ready to submit your project, click the "Submit" button at the bottom of the page or the "Submission" tab at the top of the page and follow the instructions. One of Practicum's professional developers will review your work.
Before uploading the project for review, make sure you store all of your project files in a folder, then compress this folder into a zip archive.
What tools do I need?
To complete this project, all you need is a browser and a code editor. You already have a browser, and you can download and install a code editor. We recommend Visual Studio Code as it's free and widely available.
You can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/.
Installation instructions for Windows:

Installation instructions for macOS:

Another thing that you might find useful is the developer tools, which allow you inspect code right in the browser without making any changes to the source. This way, you can check your project in the browser and ensure that it matches the design. Watch the video explaining the main things you can do with this and coding will become a lot easier for you.

Good luck!
Now you have all the information you need to complete your first independent project, so get out there and start coding!
